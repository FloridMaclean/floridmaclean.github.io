                    <p>
                        I'm a dedicated mobile developer and entrepreneur with a passion for creating 
                        intuitive and innovative applications. With years of experience in the mobile 
                        development industry, I've developed a deep understanding of user experience, 
                        performance optimization, and modern development practices.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        As the Founder of Catch The Event, I've built a comprehensive event management 
                        platform that serves thousands of organizers and attendees across Canada and the US. 
                        This entrepreneurial experience has given me valuable insights into product development, 
                        user needs, and scalable solutions.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I'm also passionate about community building and serve as an Organizer for Google 
                        Developer Groups London, where I lead a community of 205+ developers. Through GDG London, 
                        I organize tech talks, workshops, and events that connect developers with the latest 
                        Google technologies and foster meaningful professional relationships.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Currently, I serve as a Professor at Fanshawe College, where I have the 
                        privilege of teaching and mentoring the next generation of mobile developers. 
                        I believe in combining theoretical knowledge with practical, hands-on experience 
                        to prepare students for real-world challenges.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        My approach to both development and teaching centers around clean code, 
                        user-centered design, and continuous learning. I'm always exploring new 
                        technologies and methodologies to stay at the forefront of mobile development.
